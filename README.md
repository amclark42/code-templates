# Code templates

This repository collects files I use as starting points, or templates. I generally keep these in one directory, and set [oXygen](oxygenxml.com) to use that directory when it prompts me to choose the format of a new file.

I doubt these are useful to anyone else. That said, you have my permission to make copies and do whatever you want with them!
